# PocketFind

Pocket Find is a location-based mobile application that helps users discover nearby shops and services for any product—from food and cafés to clothes, household items, electronics, and daily essentials.

Users can:

Search for any product (clothes, groceries, utensils, street food, stationery, etc.)

See which nearby shops sell it

Compare prices across local stores

Discover hidden, affordable, and high-quality local options

Explore shops and cuisines that are usually unknown or offline-only

For example, a user can find a Rs. 100 Jhampat, affordable clothing, or daily household items nearby—even if the shop has no online presence.

Pocket Find helps people save money, save time, and support local businesses.
